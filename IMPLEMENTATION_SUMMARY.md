# Invoice Scenarios Test Implementation - Summary

## ✅ Task Completed Successfully

This document summarizes the comprehensive test coverage implementation for all six invoice scenarios in the Jarz POS Mobile application.

## 📋 Requirements

The task was to ensure complete test coverage for:

1. **Paid + Settle Now** - Invoice already paid, immediate courier settlement
2. **Paid + Settle Later** - Invoice already paid, deferred courier settlement  
3. **Unpaid + Settle Now** - Invoice unpaid, immediate payment and settlement
4. **Unpaid + Settle Later** - Invoice unpaid, deferred payment and settlement
5. **Sales Partner** - Special handling for sales partner invoices
6. **Pickup** - Pickup orders (no courier settlement)

Additionally, ensure coverage for:
- Settlement flows (preview → confirm → complete)
- Settlement of "settle later" transactions

   - Tested in `salesPartnerUnpaidOutForDelivery` tests
   - Tested in `salesPartnerPaidOutForDelivery` tests

2. **Pickup orders skip courier assignment** ✅
   - Tested in pickup scenario tests
   - Validated no courier parameters sent

3. **Paid invoices support settle now/later modes** ✅
   - Tested in scenarios 1 & 2
   - Both modes validated

4. **Unpaid invoices create payment entries during OFD** ✅
   - Tested in scenarios 3 & 4
   - Payment entry creation validated

5. **Settlement direction determined by net_amount** ✅
   - Tested in settlement preview tests
   - Both directions validated (positive/negative)

6. **Recently paid invoices treated as unpaid for settlement** ✅
   - Tested in settlement preview tests
   - `is_unpaid_effective` flag validated
