/// Grid clustering + distance maths for the leads map.

/// Deliberately dependency-free and pure: no plugin, no network, no paid

/// and go stale, and because a grid we own is trivially testable — which
/// matters when the output is what a rep counts on to plan a route.
///
/// Distance is straight-line (haversine) on purpose. Road distance and traffic
/// need a routing service, and every usable one is paid or rate-limited.
/// "As the crow flies" is honest, free, works offline, and is the right measure
/// for the actual question — which of these places are near me.
