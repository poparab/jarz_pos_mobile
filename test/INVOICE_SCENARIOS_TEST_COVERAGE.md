End-to-end workflow tests demonstrating complete invoice lifecycle for all scenarios.

## Six Invoice Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Paid + Settle Now
**Description**: Invoice is already paid, and courier settlement happens immediately.

**Test Coverage**:
- ✅ Create invoice with cash payment type
- ✅ Pay invoice with cash/wallet/instapay
- ✅ Get settlement preview (paid invoice)
- ✅ Settle when courier collected payment from customer (`settleCourierCollectedPayment`)
- ✅ Settle when branch pays courier shipping expense (`settleSingleInvoicePaid`)
- ✅ Integration test: Complete workflow from creation to settlement

**Key Test Cases**:
```dart
// Branch pays courier shipping
test('settleSingleInvoicePaid - handles when branch pays courier shipping expense')

// Courier collected payment
test('settleCourierCollectedPayment - handles when courier collected payment from customer')

// Complete workflow
test('Complete workflow: create paid invoice → OFD → settle immediately')
```

### Scenario 2: Paid + Settle Later
**Description**: Invoice is already paid, but courier settlement is deferred.

**Test Coverage**:
- ✅ Create invoice with online payment
- ✅ Pay invoice with wallet/instapay
- ✅ Transition to Out For Delivery with 'later' mode
- ✅ Settlement deferred via courier transaction
- ✅ Integration test: Complete workflow with deferred settlement

**Key Test Cases**:
```dart
test('handleOutForDeliveryTransition - supports settle later mode')
test('handleOutForDeliveryTransition - includes optional party info for settle later')
test('Complete workflow: create paid invoice → OFD with settle later')
```

### Scenario 3: Unpaid + Settle Now
**Description**: Invoice is unpaid (COD), and payment entry + settlement happen immediately during OFD transition.

**Test Coverage**:
- ✅ Create unpaid invoice
- ✅ Transition to OFD with 'pay_now' mode (creates payment entry)
- ✅ Mark courier outstanding
- ✅ Immediate settlement processing
- ✅ Integration test: Unpaid COD with immediate settlement

**Key Test Cases**:
```dart
test('handleOutForDeliveryTransition - handles unpaid with pay_now mode')
test('markCourierOutstanding - creates payment entry for unpaid invoice')
test('Complete workflow: create unpaid COD → OFD with pay_now → immediate settlement')
```

### Scenario 4: Unpaid + Settle Later
**Description**: Invoice is unpaid (COD), and both payment and settlement are deferred.

**Test Coverage**:
- ✅ Create unpaid invoice
- ✅ Transition to OFD with 'later' mode
- ✅ Payment entry created but settlement deferred
- ✅ Integration test: Unpaid COD with deferred settlement

**Key Test Cases**:
```dart
test('handleOutForDeliveryTransition - handles unpaid with later mode')
test('Complete workflow: create unpaid COD → OFD with later mode')
```

### Scenario 5: Sales Partner
**Description**: Special handling for sales partner invoices (no courier settlement needed).

**Test Coverage**:
- ✅ Create invoice with sales partner
- ✅ Sales partner unpaid → auto payment + OFD (`salesPartnerUnpaidOutForDelivery`)
- ✅ Sales partner paid → OFD only (`salesPartnerPaidOutForDelivery`)
- ✅ No courier settlement required
- ✅ Integration tests for both paid and unpaid sales partner flows

**Key Test Cases**:
```dart
// Unpaid sales partner
test('salesPartnerUnpaidOutForDelivery - creates payment and DN for unpaid sales partner invoice')
test('Complete workflow: unpaid sales partner → auto payment + OFD')

// Paid sales partner  
test('salesPartnerPaidOutForDelivery - creates DN for already paid sales partner invoice')
test('Complete workflow: paid sales partner → OFD (no settlement needed)')
```

### Scenario 6: Pickup
**Description**: Pickup orders - no courier involved, no settlement needed.

**Test Coverage**:
- ✅ Create invoice with pickup flag
- ✅ Direct state transitions without courier
- ✅ No settlement flow required
- ✅ Integration test: Pickup order workflow

**Key Test Cases**:
```dart
test('createInvoice - creates pickup invoice with isPickup flag')
test('updateInvoiceState - handles pickup invoice state changes directly')
test('Complete workflow: pickup order → no courier settlement')
```

## Settlement Flow Coverage

### Settlement Preview
**Tests**: 3 tests covering preview generation and data validation

**Coverage**:
- ✅ Generate settlement preview for any invoice
- ✅ Include party information (courier/supplier details)
- ✅ Determine settlement type based on net_amount
- ✅ Identify recently paid invoices as "unpaid effective"

**Key Methods Tested**:
- `getInvoiceSettlementPreview()`

### Settlement Confirmation
**Tests**: 6 tests covering both settlement scenarios

**Coverage**:
- ✅ Courier collected payment (net_amount > 0, courier owes branch)
- ✅ Branch pays shipping (net_amount < 0, branch owes courier)
- ✅ Journal entry creation
- ✅ Error handling

**Key Methods Tested**:
- `settleCourierCollectedPayment()`
- `settleSingleInvoicePaid()`

### Settle Later Processing
**Tests**: 4 tests covering deferred settlement

**Coverage**:
- ✅ Create courier transaction for later settlement
- ✅ Mark as deferred
- ✅ Include idempotency token
- ✅ Support both paid and unpaid invoices

**Key Methods Tested**:
- `handleOutForDeliveryTransition(mode: 'later')`

## Courier Management

**Tests**: 5 tests covering courier operations

**Coverage**:
- ✅ Fetch active couriers (employees/suppliers)
- ✅ Create new delivery party (employee/supplier)
- ✅ Support first/last name or full name
- ✅ Include branch/phone information

**Key Methods Tested**:
- `fetchCouriers()`
- `createDeliveryParty()`

## Payment Processing

**Tests**: 8 tests covering payment methods

**Coverage**:
- ✅ Cash payment (requires POS profile)
- ✅ Wallet payment (requires reference)
- ✅ InstaPay payment (requires reference)

- ✅ Missing required parameters
- ✅ Backend validation failures

## Idempotency

**Tests**: 2 tests covering idempotency

**Coverage**:
- ✅ Token generation (unique, non-colliding)

flutter test --name "Sales Partner"

# Pickup tests  
flutter test --name "Pickup"

# Settlement tests
flutter test --name "Settlement"
```

## Key Assertions & Patterns

### Testing Paid vs Unpaid
```dart
// Check invoice status
expect(invoice['status'], equals('Paid'));
expect(invoice['status'], equals('Unpaid'));

// Check payment entry creation
expect(result['payment_entry'], isNotNull);
```

### Testing Settlement Flows
```dart
// Courier collected (net > 0)
expect(preview['net_amount'], greaterThan(0));
await settleCourierCollectedPayment(...);

// Branch pays (net < 0)
expect(preview['net_amount'], lessThan(0));
await settleSingleInvoicePaid(...);
```

### Testing Sales Partner
```dart
// Check sales partner flag
expect(invoice['sales_partner'], equals('PARTNER-A'));

// Use dedicated endpoint
await salesPartnerUnpaidOutForDelivery(...);
await salesPartnerPaidOutForDelivery(...);
```

### Testing Pickup
```dart
// Check pickup flag
expect(invoice['pickup'], equals(1));
expect(invoice['is_pickup'], isTrue);

// No courier settlement
await updateInvoiceState('Ready for Pickup');
```

## Business Logic Validation

Each test validates specific business rules:

1. **Sales Partner invoices** bypass courier settlement
2. **Pickup orders** skip courier assignment entirely
3. **Paid invoices** can settle now or later
4. **Unpaid invoices** create payment entries during OFD
5. **Settlement direction** determined by net_amount sign
6. **Recently paid** invoices treated as unpaid for settlement

## Mock Data Patterns

### Invoice Creation
```dart
final items = [
  {
    'item_code': 'ITEM-001',
    'quantity': 2,
    'rate': 50.0,
    'amount': 100.0,
  },
];
```

### Settlement Preview
```dart
final preview = {
  'invoice_name': 'INV-001',
  'outstanding': 100.00,
  'shipping_expense': 20.00,
  'net_amount': 80.00,
  'is_unpaid_effective': false,
};
```

### Courier Data
```dart
final courier = {
  'party_type': 'Employee',
  'party': 'EMP-001',
  'display_name': 'John Courier',
};
```
