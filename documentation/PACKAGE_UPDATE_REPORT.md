## 📋 Notes on Package Discontinuations

Flutter analyze reported these discontinued packages (transitive dependencies):
- `js` - Discontinued, but still functional. Part of Dart SDK migration.
- `build_resolvers` - Discontinued, but still functional. 
- `build_runner_core` - Discontinued, but still functional.

These are indirect dependencies and don't require immediate action as they still work correctly.
