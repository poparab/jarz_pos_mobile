# steps must succeed in. On staging it is cloned at
# /var/lib/docker/volumes/erp_apps/_data/jarz_courier (uid 1000, full clone) but
# NOT yet pip-installed, so `bench install-app` still fails with
# ModuleNotFoundError. It has been removed from sites/apps.txt again — leaving a
# name there that Python cannot import makes `bench list-apps` print a traceback
# to stderr, which this script's Invoke-Remote turns into a fatal
# NativeCommandError and takes every deploy down with it.
#
# Remaining step, to run once and confirm before re-adding jarz_courier to
# $deployedApps:
#
#   docker exec -u root <backend> /home/frappe/frappe-bench/env/bin/pip \

#   docker exec <backend> /home/frappe/frappe-bench/env/bin/python \
#       -c "import jarz_courier"      # must succeed before going further
#
# Then re-add it to $deployedApps and deploy: the bootstrap re-adds apps.txt,
# installs into all four service envs and runs `bench install-app`.
#
# Order is load-bearing throughout: clone -> chown -> pip install -> apps.txt ->
# install-app. Every earlier attempt failed by reaching a later step with an
